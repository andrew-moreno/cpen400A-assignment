# CPEN400A Assignment: Building Modern Web Applications

This project was a semester long assignment as part of a computer engineering course I took during my degree. The course was focused around full-stack development of modern web applications. This assignment consisted of 5 parts, each dedicated to a key component of full stack development:
1. Building the Client-side GUI
2. Dynamically Rendering the Client-side Application
3. Exchanging Data with the Server
4. Data Persistence using MongoDB
5. Adding Authentication and Securing the Application

 The original repository is currently privated, so here is a cloned version of the project after completion of part 5.
